description: 'Set up API keys and authenticate your requests'
---

## Overview

BoostGPT uses API keys to authenticate requests. You'll need two pieces of information:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API Key" icon="key">
    Used to authenticate all API requests
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project ID" icon="fingerprint">
    Identifies which project you're working with
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Your Credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Sign up at [app.boostgpt.co](https://app.boostgpt.co) if you haven't already.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a project">
    Create a new project from your dashboard. Each project is isolated with its own bots and data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get your Project ID">
    Go to your project settings to find your **Project ID**. You can also find it at [app.boostgpt.co/settings](https://app.boostgpt.co/settings).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate an API key">
    Navigate to [API Keys](https://app.boostgpt.co/account/api-keys) and click "Generate New Key". Copy it immediately - you won't be able to see it again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Keep your API key secure!** Never commit it to version control or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Using Environment Variables

The recommended way to store your credentials is using environment variables.

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash .env
BOOSTGPT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BOOSTGPT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`:

```bash .gitignore
.env
node_modules/
```

Load environment variables in your code:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ES Modules">
    ```javascript
    import 'dotenv/config';
    
    const apiKey = process.env.BOOSTGPT_API_KEY;
    const projectId = process.env.BOOSTGPT_PROJECT_ID;
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="CommonJS">
    ```javascript
    require('dotenv').config();
    
    const apiKey = process.env.BOOSTGPT_API_KEY;
    const projectId = process.env.BOOSTGPT_PROJECT_ID;
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## SDK Authentication

### Core SDK

```javascript
import { BoostGPT } from 'boostgpt';

const client = new BoostGPT({
  key: process.env.BOOSTGPT_API_KEY,
  project_id: process.env.BOOSTGPT_PROJECT_ID
});
```

### Router SDK

```javascript
import { Router } from '@boostgpt/router';

const router = new Router({
  apiKey: process.env.BOOSTGPT_API_KEY,
  projectId: process.env.BOOSTGPT_PROJECT_ID,
  // ... adapters
});
```

<Info>
  The Router SDK uses `apiKey` (camelCase) while the Core SDK uses `key`. Both accept the same API key value.
</Info>

## REST API Authentication

When making direct REST API calls, include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.boostgpt.co/v1/bot/read \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    "bot_id": "YOUR_BOT_ID"
  }'
```

## Multiple Projects

If you're working with multiple projects, you can create separate clients:

```javascript
const productionClient = new BoostGPT({
  key: process.env.BOOSTGPT_API_KEY_PROD,
  project_id: process.env.BOOSTGPT_PROJECT_ID_PROD
});

const stagingClient = new BoostGPT({
  key: process.env.BOOSTGPT_API_KEY_STAGING,
  project_id: process.env.BOOSTGPT_PROJECT_ID_STAGING
});
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Never hardcode credentials">
    Always use environment variables or a secrets manager. Never commit API keys to git.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="rotate" title="Rotate keys regularly">
    Generate new API keys periodically and revoke old ones from your dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Use separate keys per environment">
    Use different API keys for development, staging, and production.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="eye-slash" title="Restrict key access">
    Only give API keys to team members who need them. Track which keys are used where.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing API Keys

You can manage your API keys from the [API Keys dashboard](https://app.boostgpt.co/account/api-keys):

- **Generate new keys** - Create additional API keys for different environments
- **Revoke keys** - Immediately disable compromised or unused keys
- **View usage** - See which keys are being used and when

<Warning>
  Revoking an API key will immediately break any applications using it. Make sure to update your applications before revoking keys.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

BoostGPT applies rate limits to ensure fair usage:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Free Tier" icon="gift">
    1,000 requests per day
  </Card>
  <Card title="Paid Plans" icon="bolt">
    Higher limits based on your plan
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

If you hit rate limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic:

```javascript
async function makeRequestWithRetry(requestFn, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await requestFn();
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.status === 429 && i < maxRetries - 1) {
        const delay = Math.pow(2, i) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
        continue;
      }
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-xmark" title="401 Unauthorized">
    Your API key is invalid or missing. Double-check that you're using the correct key and it hasn't been revoked.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="ban" title="403 Forbidden">
    Your API key doesn't have access to the requested resource. Verify you're using the correct Project ID.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="429 Too Many Requests">
    You've exceeded your rate limit. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff or upgrade your plan.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
