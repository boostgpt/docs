<Update label="February 2026" tags={["New releases"]} rss={{ title: "Workspaces — Sandbox File System", description: "Agents can create, edit, and manage files in isolated sandbox workspaces" }}>

  ## Workspaces

  Agents now have a sandbox file system — isolated workspaces where they can create, read, edit, search, and delete files:

  - **Built-in tools** — `write`, `read`, `edit`, `grep`, and `delete` tools available to agents in `agent` reasoning mode
  - **Per-user isolation** — authenticated users get their own workspace per agent, anonymous users get a chat-scoped workspace
  - **File explorer** — built-in file tree UI with syntax-highlighted code viewer
  - **Real-time sync** — files created or edited by the agent appear instantly in the workspace explorer
  - **REST API** — full workspace and file management via the API for programmatic access

  See the [Workspaces documentation](/sdk/core/workspaces) for usage details.

</Update>

<Update label="February 2026" tags={["Breaking changes"]} rss={{ title: "Agent Reasoning Mode", description: "New autonomous agent mode replaces interactive, stepwise, and react reasoning types" }}>

  ## Agent reasoning mode

  The reasoning system has been simplified to three modes:

  - **`auto`** — automatically selects the best approach for each request
  - **`standard`** — quick, single-pass answers (1x credit)
  - **`agent`** — autonomous multi-step reasoning with tool use (up to 10x credit)

  The `agent` mode replaces the previous `interactive`, `stepwise`, and `react` modes with a unified autonomous agent loop that can read files, search, edit code, execute tools, and plan multi-step workflows.

  **Deprecated:** `interactive`, `stepwise`, and `react` reasoning modes are no longer supported. Use `agent` instead.

</Update>

<Update label="February 2026" tags={["New releases"]} rss={{ title: "Plan Chat Mode", description: "Conversational planning before tool execution" }}>

  ## Plan chat mode

  Conversational "plan-then-execute" workflow for multi-step tasks:

  - **Plan mode** (`chat_mode: 'plan'`) — AI proposes a step-by-step plan before executing any tools
  - **Approve / Modify / New** — approve to execute, reply with changes to revise, or start a fresh plan
  - **Tool-aware plans** — the AI considers all available tools (built-in and connected integrations) when generating plans
  - **Direct answers** — if no tools are needed, bypasses planning and responds directly

  See the [Chat API documentation](/sdk/core/chat-api#plan-chat-mode) for usage details.

</Update>

<Update label="February 2026" tags={["New releases"]} rss={{ title: "Edit Chat Mode", description: "Agent-powered code editing with built-in edit tool" }}>

  ## Edit chat mode

  Agent-powered code editing through the agent reasoning pipeline:

  - **Edit mode** (`chat_mode: 'edit'`) — routes your request through the agent, which uses the built-in `edit` tool for targeted file changes
  - **Toggle switch** — Chat/Edit/Plan toggle next to the send button
  - **Edit button** — per-message "Edit" action on system messages with code blocks
  - **Smart editing** — the agent analyzes your request, locates the right file, and applies precise string replacements
  - **Multi-step edits** — the agent can chain multiple edits across files in a single turn

  See the [Chat API documentation](/sdk/core/chat-api#edit-chat-mode) for usage details.

</Update>

<Update label="February 2026" tags={["New releases"]} rss={{ title: "Heartbeat — Autonomous Agent Scheduling", description: "Agents run autonomously on a timer with built-in safety controls and full API access" }}>

  ## Heartbeat scheduling

  Transform agents from passive chatbots into proactive autonomous assistants:

  - **Autonomous execution** — agents wake up on a timer, execute a prompt, use connected tools, and report back
  - **Flexible scheduling** — configurable intervals, active hours, active days, and timezone support
  - **notify_user** — agents can send notifications (email, in-app) to subscribers during execution
  - **schedule_task** — agents can create their own recurring tasks for follow-up actions
  - **message_agent** — agent-to-agent async communication for multi-agent workflows

  ## Safety controls

  - **Circuit breaker** — auto-pause after consecutive failures (configurable threshold)
  - **Credit budgets** — per-heartbeat spending limits that reset monthly
  - **Plan-tier caps** — maximum heartbeats per agent and minimum intervals enforced per plan
  - **Bot-level toggle** — per-agent heartbeat enable/disable in Settings → Features & Options

  ## Execution dashboard

  - **Logs** — every execution with status, duration, tokens, and credits charged
  - **Activity chart** — daily visualization of execution volume
  - **Stats** — success rate, type breakdowns, and time-series data

  ## API access

  Full heartbeat management via the external API (`/v1/bot/heartbeat/*`) — create, list, enable, disable, trigger, delete, view logs, and get stats programmatically.

  See the [Heartbeat guide](/creators/heartbeat) for no-code setup or the [Heartbeat API](/sdk/core/heartbeat) for programmatic access.

</Update>

<Update label="February 2026" tags={["New releases"]} rss={{ title: "User Memory & Context Compaction", description: "Agents remember user preferences across conversations with automatic context management" }}>

  ## User memory

  Agents now remember user preferences, facts, and context across conversations:

  - **Automatic memory** — agents learn and store important details (names, preferences, decisions) from natural conversation
  - **Per-user isolation** — each user has their own private memory store, separate from agent training data
  - **Memory bootstrap** — relevant memories are automatically injected into context at the start of each conversation
  - **Vector-powered recall** — memories are semantically searchable, so the most relevant context surfaces automatically
  - **Memory management** — view and delete per-user memories from the **Subscribers** page in the dashboard

  ## Context compaction

  Long conversations no longer hit context window limits:

  - **Automatic compaction** — when conversation context reaches 70% of the model's limit, older messages are summarized
  - **Memory-safe** — important facts are extracted and saved to user memory before compaction
  - **Model-aware** — compaction threshold adapts to each model's actual context window size
  - **Transparent** — recent messages are preserved intact, only older history is summarized

</Update>


<Update label="January 2026" tags={["New releases"]} rss={{ title: "Proactive Agent Events & Trigger System", description: "Engage users proactively with contextual triggers, screenshot capture, and multi-bot support" }}>

  ## Proactive trigger system

  Transform your agents from passive chatbots into proactive assistants that reach out at the right moment:

  - **Smart triggers**: Fire events based on user behavior (errors, cart abandonment, page visits)
  - **Multiple UI types**: Button, toast notification, banner, or inline embed
  - **Customizable appearance**: Colors, text, positioning, animations
  - **Delayed triggers**: Show help after a configurable delay

  ## Screenshot capture

  Capture visual context when triggers fire to give your agent full situational awareness:

  - **Automatic screenshots**: Capture the page when users click the trigger
  - **Quality control**: Configurable JPEG quality and max dimensions
  - **Privacy-first**: Opt-in only, users must enable per-trigger
  - **Requires html2canvas**: Lightweight dependency (~40KB gzipped)

  ## Multi-bot routing

  Route different events to specialized agents on the same page:

  - **Per-trigger botId**: Override the default agent for specific triggers
  - **Specialized agents**: Sales bot for pricing, support bot for errors, billing bot for invoices
  - **No re-initialization**: Switch between bots without calling init() again

  ## Rich context passing

  Provide your agents with full situational context:

  - **Source URL**: Agents know which page the user is on
  - **Custom context**: Pass any data (cart value, error codes, user info)
  - **User identification**: Associate triggers with logged-in users
  - **Prompt templates**: Use `{{context.field}}` in agent instructions

  Get started with the [Trigger Script documentation](/saas/trigger-script/installation).
