<Update label="January 2026" tags={["New releases"]} rss={{ title: "Proactive Agent Events & Trigger System", description: "Engage users proactively with contextual triggers, screenshot capture, and multi-bot support" }}>

  ## Proactive trigger system

  Transform your agents from passive chatbots into proactive assistants that reach out at the right moment:

  - **Smart triggers**: Fire events based on user behavior (errors, cart abandonment, page visits)
  - **Multiple UI types**: Button, toast notification, banner, or inline embed
  - **Customizable appearance**: Colors, text, positioning, animations
  - **Delayed triggers**: Show help after a configurable delay

  ## Screenshot capture

  Capture visual context when triggers fire to give your agent full situational awareness:

  - **Automatic screenshots**: Capture the page when users click the trigger
  - **Quality control**: Configurable JPEG quality and max dimensions
  - **Privacy-first**: Opt-in only, users must enable per-trigger
  - **Requires html2canvas**: Lightweight dependency (~40KB gzipped)

  ## Multi-bot routing

  Route different events to specialized agents on the same page:

  - **Per-trigger botId**: Override the default agent for specific triggers
  - **Specialized agents**: Sales bot for pricing, support bot for errors, billing bot for invoices
  - **No re-initialization**: Switch between bots without calling init() again

  ## Rich context passing

  Provide your agents with full situational context:

  - **Source URL**: Agents know which page the user is on
  - **Custom context**: Pass any data (cart value, error codes, user info)
  - **User identification**: Associate triggers with logged-in users
  - **Prompt templates**: Use `{{context.field}}` in agent instructions

  Get started with the [Trigger Script documentation](/saas/trigger-script/installation).
