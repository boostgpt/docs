## What are Built-in Tools?

When your agent runs in **Agent** reasoning mode, it has access to a powerful set of built-in tools. These tools let your agent search knowledge, manage files, remember users, plan complex tasks, and more — all without any setup or configuration.

<Info>
Built-in tools are only available in **Agent** reasoning mode. Switch your agent's reasoning mode in **Settings → Reasoning**.
</Info>

## Available Tools

### Knowledge & Research

Your agent can search its training data and capture web pages:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Search Knowledge** | Searches through your agent's uploaded documents and training data using AI-powered similarity search |
| **Screenshot** | Captures a visual screenshot of any web page — useful for analyzing designs, checking content, or monitoring pages |
| **Web Fetch** | Extracts a web page's text content as structured markdown — useful for reading articles, documentation, or any page content |

### User Memory

When [User Memory](/creators/user-memory) is enabled, your agent can manage what it remembers about each user:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Remember** | Saves important details about the user (name, preferences, decisions) to long-term memory |
| **Recall** | Searches through saved memories to find relevant information |
| **List Memories** | Shows all saved memories for the current user |
| **Forget** | Removes a specific memory about the user |

### File Operations

When your agent has access to a [Workspace](/creators/workspaces), it can create and manage files:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Write** | Creates new files or overwrites existing ones |
| **Read** | Reads file contents (can target specific line ranges) |
| **Edit** | Makes precise, targeted changes to existing files |
| **Search** | Finds patterns across all workspace files using regex |
| **Delete** | Removes files from the workspace |

### Planning

For complex tasks, your agent can create structured plans and execute them step by step:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Create Plan** | Writes a detailed plan document and registers it for tracking |
| **Update Plan** | Modifies the plan, advances to the next step, or marks steps complete |
| **Read Plan** | Checks the current plan's status and progress |
| **Accept Plan** | Submits a draft plan for your approval before execution begins |

<Info>
Plans always require your approval before the agent starts executing. This gives you a chance to review, modify, or reject the approach.
</Info>

### Communication

Your agent can interact with users and other agents:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Ask User** | Presents structured questions with selectable options — great for gathering preferences or confirming approaches |
| **Notify User** | Sends a proactive notification when something needs attention |
| **Message Agent** | Sends a message to another agent in your project for cross-agent collaboration |

### Automation

Your agent can set up tasks that run on a schedule:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Schedule Task** | Creates a recurring task that runs automatically (e.g., daily reports, weekly checks) |

### Reasoning

Your agent has an internal thinking tool:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Think** | Reasons through a problem step-by-step without showing the thinking to the user — helps the agent plan its approach |

## Tool Approval Levels

Built-in tools have three approval levels that control when your agent needs permission to act:

| Level | Behavior | Examples |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Auto** | Executes immediately without asking | Search, Read, Think, Recall |
| **Conditional** | May require approval depending on your settings | Write, Edit, Delete |
| **Always** | Always asks for your approval first | Accept Plan, Ask User |

## Best Practices

- Use **Agent** reasoning mode for tasks that require multiple tools (research + writing, reading + editing)
- Let your agent create plans for complex multi-step tasks — review the plan before approving
- Enable **User Memory** for agents with repeat users to provide personalized experiences
- The **Ask User** tool is great for gathering requirements before the agent starts working
- Use **Schedule Task** for automated monitoring, reporting, or maintenance workflows
