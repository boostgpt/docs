## What is Heartbeat?

Heartbeat turns your agent from a passive chatbot into an autonomous assistant. Instead of waiting for someone to send a message, your agent wakes up on a schedule, executes a prompt, uses its connected tools, and can notify users — all without human interaction.

<Info>
**Heartbeat vs Chat**: Chat is reactive — users ask, the agent responds. Heartbeat is proactive — the agent runs on its own, checks things, takes actions, and reports back.
</Info>

## How to Enable

1. Go to your agent's **Settings** page
2. Scroll to **Features & Options**
3. Toggle **Heartbeat** on

<Warning>
Heartbeat is available on **Starter** plans and above. Free and Hobby plans will see an "Upgrade" badge on the toggle.
</Warning>

Once enabled, a new **Heartbeat** tab will appear on your agent's page where you can create and manage heartbeat configurations.

## Creating a Heartbeat

Navigate to the **Heartbeat** tab on your agent's page and click **Create Heartbeat**.

### Configuration Options

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Prompt** | The instruction your agent executes each time it runs (e.g., "Check for new support tickets and summarize them") |
| **Interval** | How often the agent runs (minimum depends on your plan) |
| **Active Hours** | Start and end time to restrict when the agent runs (e.g., 09:00–17:00) |
| **Active Days** | Which days of the week the agent should run (e.g., Monday–Friday) |
| **Timezone** | Timezone for active hours and days |
| **Credit Budget** | Maximum credits this heartbeat can consume per billing period (optional) |

### Plan Limits

| Plan | Max Heartbeats per Agent | Minimum Interval |
|------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Starter | 3 | 15 minutes |
| Pro | 10 | 5 minutes |
| Prime | 20 | 5 minutes |

## Execution & Notifications

When a heartbeat fires, the agent:

1. Receives the configured prompt
2. Uses any connected tools (CRM, email, calendar, etc.) to gather information or take actions
3. Can send notifications to users via the **notify_user** capability
4. Logs the execution result (success, error, or skipped)

Each heartbeat gets a fresh conversation thread daily, so the agent starts with clean context each day while retaining long-term knowledge through its memory.

## Scheduled Tasks

Agents with heartbeat enabled can also create their own recurring tasks. During a heartbeat execution, the agent may decide to schedule follow-up actions using the **schedule_task** capability — for example, "remind the user about their appointment tomorrow at 9 AM."

Scheduled tasks have their own limits per plan and per subscriber.

## Execution Logs & Stats

The **Heartbeat** tab provides:

- **Execution logs** — Every run with status (success/error/skipped), duration, tokens used, and credits charged
- **Activity chart** — Daily visualization of execution volume
- **Stats breakdown** — Success rate, total executions, active heartbeats, and per-type breakdowns
- **Filtering** — Filter logs by status, heartbeat, or date range

## Safety Features

Heartbeats include built-in safety controls:

- **Circuit breaker** — If a heartbeat fails 5 consecutive times (configurable), it automatically pauses to prevent runaway errors
- **Credit budget** — Set a maximum credit spend per billing period. The heartbeat pauses when the budget is exhausted and resets monthly
- **Plan-tier caps** — Maximum heartbeats per agent and minimum intervals are enforced per plan
- **Active hours** — Restrict execution to business hours to avoid off-hours actions

## Best Practices

- Enable for agents that monitor, report, or take recurring actions (daily summaries, ticket checks, status updates)
- Set a credit budget to prevent unexpected costs
- Use active hours to avoid running during off-hours
- Review execution logs regularly, especially after first enabling
- Start with longer intervals and decrease as you gain confidence
- Connect the tools your agent needs before creating heartbeats
