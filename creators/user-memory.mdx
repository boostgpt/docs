## What is User Memory?

User Memory lets your agent remember things about individual users across conversations — their name, preferences, past decisions, and more. Each user gets their own private memory.

<Info>
**User Memory vs Training Data**: Training data teaches your agent _what it knows_ (your FAQs, products, policies). User Memory personalizes _how it responds_ to each individual user.

## How to Enable

1. Go to your agent's **Settings** page
2. Scroll to **Features & Options**
3. Toggle **User Memory** on

Once enabled, your agent will automatically:
- Learn important details from conversations (names, preferences, decisions)
- Recall relevant memories at the start of each new conversation
- Update memories when information changes

## What Gets Remembered

Your agent automatically picks up on:

- **Facts** — user's name, company, role, location
- **Preferences** — communication style, product interests, language
- **Decisions** — choices made, plans discussed, agreements reached
- **Context** — ongoing projects, past issues, relationship history

## Managing Memories

View and manage what your agent remembers about each user:

1. Go to the **Subscribers** page
2. Click the memory icon next to a subscriber
3. Browse, search, or delete individual memories

Each memory shows its content, type (semantic, episodic, or procedural), and when it was created.

## Best Practices

✅ Enable for agents that have repeat users (support, coaching, sales)
✅ Review memories periodically via the Subscribers page
✅ Let users know your agent remembers context (builds trust)
❌ Don't enable for anonymous one-off interactions (no user to associate memories with)
❌ Don't rely on memory for critical data — it's AI-extracted, not manually entered
