## Common Issues

### Authentication Failed

**Error**: `Unauthorized: Invalid API key`

**Solutions**:
- Verify `BOOSTGPT_PROJECT_ID` and `BOOSTGPT_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Generate new API key from dashboard if needed
- Check that credentials are not expired
- Ensure no extra spaces in environment variables

```javascript
// Check credentials are loaded
console.log('Project ID:', process.env.BOOSTGPT_PROJECT_ID);
console.log('API Key:', process.env.BOOSTGPT_API_KEY ? 'Set' : 'Missing');
```

### Bot Not Found

**Error**: `Bot not found`

**Solutions**:
- Verify bot ID is correct
- Check bot exists in your project
- Ensure bot status is `active`
- Confirm you have access to the bot

```javascript
// List all bots to find correct ID
const bots = await client.listBots();
console.log('Available bots:', bots.response);
```

### Rate Limit Exceeded

**Error**: `Rate limit exceeded`

**Solutions**:
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add delays between requests
- Use request queue for high volume
- Upgrade to higher plan for more requests

See [Rate Limits](/developers/rate-limits) for detailed solutions.

### Model Not Available

**Error**: `Model not supported`

**Solutions**:
- Check model name spelling (e.g., `gpt-5-mini` not `gpt5-mini`)
- Verify model is available in your region
- Check model pricing and credit balance
- See [Model Comparison](/providers/model-comparison) for available models

### Insufficient Credits

**Error**: `Insufficient credits`

**Solutions**:
- Check credit balance in dashboard
- Add more credits or upgrade plan
- Use cheaper models for testing (e.g., `gemini-flash-lite`)

### Connection Timeout

**Error**: `Request timeout`

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify API endpoint is reachable
- Increase timeout in HTTP client
- Try again as it may be temporary

```javascript
// Set custom timeout
import axios from 'axios';

const client = axios.create({
  timeout: 30000 // 30 seconds
});
```

### Training Data Not Reflected

**Issue**: Bot doesn't use training data

**Solutions**:
- Wait a few seconds for indexing (usually instant)
- Verify training was added successfully
- Check training content is relevant to query
- Ensure bot has `access_to_memory: true` in settings

```javascript
// Verify training was added
const training = await client.addTraining({
  bot_id: 'bot-123',
  content: 'Your training content'
});

if (training.err) {
  console.error('Training failed:', training.err);
}
```

### Router SDK Not Receiving Messages

**Issue**: Router doesn't respond to messages

**Solutions**:
- Verify adapter tokens are correct (Discord, Telegram, etc.)
- Check bot has correct permissions in platform
- Ensure `router.start()` was called
- Check console for connection errors

```javascript
router.onMessage((message, context) => {
  console.log('Received message:', message.content);
  // Make sure this logs when you send messages
});
```

### Webhook Not Firing

**Issue**: Not receiving webhooks

**Solutions**:
- Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible (HTTPS required)
- Check endpoint returns 200 status code
- Test with ngrok for local development
- View webhook logs in dashboard

## Enable Debug Logging

Enable verbose logging to diagnose issues:

```javascript
import { BoostGPT } from 'boostgpt';

const client = new BoostGPT({
  project_id: process.env.BOOSTGPT_PROJECT_ID,
  key: process.env.BOOSTGPT_API_KEY,
  debug: true // Enable debug mode
});
```

## Check API Status

Verify BoostGPT services are operational:

```bash
curl https://status.boostgpt.co
```
