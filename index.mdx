## The Problem We Solve

### For Creators
You're answering the same questions all day without capturing leads or building an audience. Visitors take your knowledge and disappear—no email, no follow-up, no revenue.

### For Developers
Building AI agents for multiple platforms means writing the same logic 5+ times. Discord intents, Slack OAuth, Telegram webhooks—every platform is different. Maintenance becomes a nightmare.

### For Everyone
AI agents that can't take action are just chatbots. Your agent needs to book meetings, check inventory, process payments, and access real-time data.
