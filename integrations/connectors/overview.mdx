## Authentication & Security

All connectors use **OAuth 2.0** for secure authentication:

1. **You control access** - Grant only the permissions you need
2. **Encrypted storage** - Tokens encrypted at rest
3. **Revokable anytime** - Disconnect from Dashboard
4. **No password sharing** - BoostGPT never sees your password

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion icon="link-slash" title="Connector won't deploy">
    Make sure you have available connector slots in your plan. Free plans are limited to 1 connector.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="Authentication keeps failing">
    Clear your browser cache and try again. Some services require specific permissions that can't be skipped.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="circle-xmark" title="Tool not working after connecting">
    Verify you granted all required permissions during OAuth. Go to Dashboard ’ Integrations ’ Re-authenticate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="ban" title="Rate limit errors">
    Each service has its own rate limits (e.g., Gmail: 100 emails/day for free accounts). Check the service's documentation.
