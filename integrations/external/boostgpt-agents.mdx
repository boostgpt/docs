## Example Usage

After connecting your MCP server:

```text
# MCP Server: Internal CRM
# Tools: get_customer, create_deal, send_email

User: "Look up customer john@acme.com"

Agent: *uses get_customer tool from your MCP server*
       Found customer: John Doe from Acme Corp
       - ID: 12345
       - Status: Active
       - Lifetime value: $50,000

User: "Create a deal for them worth $10K"

Agent: *uses create_deal tool*
       Deal created successfully!
       Deal ID: DEAL-789

User: "Send them a follow-up email"

Agent: *uses send_email tool*
       Email sent to john@acme.com
```

## Multiple MCP Servers

Connect multiple MCP servers to one agent:

```text
Agent -> Tools Tab:
-  Internal CRM (https://mcp.boostgpt.co/crm)
-  Inventory System (https://mcp.boostgpt.co/inventory)
-  Billing API (https://mcp.boostgpt.co/billing)

Agent can now access all tools from all three systems!
```

## Use Cases

### Customer Support Agent

```text
MCP Servers:
- CRM: Customer lookup, ticket creation
- Knowledge Base: Search documentation
- Email System: Send responses

Agent handles:
"Hi, I need help with my order #12345"
-> Looks up order in CRM
-> Searches KB for solutions
-> Sends resolution email
```

### Sales Assistant

```text
MCP Servers:
- CRM: Deal management
- Email: Outreach
- Calendar: Meeting scheduling

Agent handles:
"Schedule demos for all hot leads this week"
-> Queries CRM for hot leads
-> Finds available calendar slots
-> Sends calendar invites via email
```

### Internal Tools Agent

```text
MCP Servers:
- Database: Query data
- Reporting: Generate reports
- Slack: Send notifications

Agent handles:
"Generate weekly sales report and post to #sales"
-> Queries database
-> Generates report
-> Posts to Slack
```

## Managing Connected Tools

### View Connected Tools

**Agent -> Tools Tab** shows all connected MCP servers and their tools

### Disconnect Tool

Click **Remove** next to disconnect

### Update MCP Server

Changes to your MCP server automatically reflect in all connected agents

## Authentication

MCP servers use authentication configured in Agent tool settings:

1. **Dashboard -> Agents -> Your Agent -> Tools -> Your Tool**
2. Configure API keys or OAuth client details
3. Save changes

## Monitoring

### Tool Usage

**Agent -> Insights Tab -> Tool Analytics**
- See which MCP tools are being used
- Track success/failure rates
- Monitor response times

### MCP Server Logs

**Dashboard -> MCP Servers -> Your Server -> Logs**
- View all requests from agents
- Debug failed tool calls
- Monitor authentication issues

## Best Practices

1. **Group related tools** - One MCP server per system/API
2. **Clear tool names** - Help agent understand what each tool does
3. **Test thoroughly** - Use Playground before deploying
4. **Monitor usage** - Check Insights regularly
5. **Update documentation** - Keep tool descriptions current
