## What are Integrations?

BoostGPT integrations allow your agents to connect to external tools and services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Give your agents the power to:

- Send emails and manage contacts
- Schedule meetings and manage calendars
- Access CRM data and update records
- Manage tasks and projects
- Read and write files
- And much more...

## How Integrations Work

BoostGPT uses **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to connect agents to external services:

1. **Deploy a connector** - Choose from 30+ pre-built connectors or build your own
2. **Connect to your agent** - Add the connector to your agent's Tools tab
3. **Agent uses tools** - Your agent automatically calls tools when needed
