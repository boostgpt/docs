## Timing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Don't trigger immediately">
    Give users time to orient themselves before offering help.

    **Recommended delays:**
    - Simple pages: 30-45 seconds
    - Complex forms: 45-90 seconds
    - Technical setup: 90-180 seconds
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Detect genuine friction, not exploration">
    Distinguish between:
    - User reading carefully (good)
    - User stuck and frustrated (needs help)

    Use multiple signals: time + inactivity + scroll position.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use exit intent carefully">
    Exit intent (mouse leaving window) is powerful but can feel aggressive.
    Reserve for high-value pages like checkout.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Frequency

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Limit triggers per session">
    - Max 2-3 triggers per session
    - Never more than 1 at a time
    - Wait 5+ minutes between triggers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Respect dismissals">
    If a user dismisses a trigger:
    - Don't show the same trigger again that session
    - Consider a 24-hour cooldown for that event
    - Track dismissal patterns to improve targeting
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Avoid trigger fatigue">
    Users who see too many triggers become blind to them.
    Quality over quantity - fewer, better-timed triggers perform better.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Messaging

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific, not generic">
    ❌ "Need help?"
    ✅ "Having trouble with payment? I can help!"

    ❌ "Click here for support"
    ✅ "Stuck on this step? I can walk you through it."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Match your brand voice">
    If your brand is:
    - Professional: "Need assistance with checkout?"
    - Friendly: "Hey! Can I help with that?"
    - Technical: "Encountering an issue? Let's debug together."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use edit mode for iterative code changes">
    When users are refining code, use edit mode instead of regenerating the full response:

    - **Toggle switch**: Use the Chat/Edit toggle next to the send button for quick successive edits
    - **Per-message Edit button**: Click the Edit action on a specific older message to target it
    - **Be specific**: "Add input validation to the email field" works better than "make it better"
    - Edit mode works best with clear, targeted change requests
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create urgency without pressure">
    ✅ "Your cart is saved for 30 minutes"
    ❌ "Buy now or lose your cart!"

    ✅ "Questions before you go?"
    ❌ "Don't leave! We need you!"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Context

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pass relevant data">
    The more context your agent has, the better it can help:

    ```javascript
    // Good
    boostgpt.trigger('checkout_help', {
      cart_value: '$149',
      items: 3,
      user_name: 'Sarah',
      time_on_page: 45,
      current_step: 'payment'
    });

    // Not as helpful
    boostgpt.trigger('help', {});
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include user info when available">
    ```javascript
    {
      user: {
        id: 'user_123',
        name: 'Sarah Chen',
        email: 'sarah@example.com',
        plan: 'pro',
        account_age: '6 months'
      }
    }
    ```

    This enables personalized responses.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Capture the user's journey">
    Include:
    - Current page/step
    - Previous pages visited
    - Actions already taken
    - Time spent
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Trigger Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match type to context">
    | Situation | Best Type |
    |-----------|-----------|
    | General availability | Button |
    | Proactive outreach | Toast |
    | Urgent/important | Banner |
    | Contextual help | Inline |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Toast for engagement">
    Toasts feel personal and conversational.
    Use them when you want higher engagement.
    Stacked messages create a chat-like experience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Button for persistence">
    Buttons are less intrusive and always available.
    Good for "just in case" help without interrupting flow.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Training Your Agent

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Include relevant knowledge">
    Your agent should know:
    - Product features and pricing
    - Common issues and solutions
    - Policies (shipping, returns, refunds)
    - Technical documentation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Write good prompt templates">
    Templates should:
    - Describe the situation clearly
    - Include all relevant context
    - Provide instructions on how to help
    - Set the right tone
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test with real scenarios">
    Before deploying, test:
    - Common user questions
    - Edge cases
    - Error scenarios
    - Various context combinations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Analytics & Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Track key metrics">
    | Metric | What It Tells You |
    |--------|-------------------|
    | Trigger Rate | How often conditions are met |
    | View Rate | How often users see triggers |
    | Engagement Rate | How often users click |
    | Resolution Rate | How often chat helps |
    | Conversion Lift | Impact on desired outcomes |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="A/B test everything">
    Test variations of:
    - Trigger timing
    - Message copy
    - Trigger type (toast vs button)
    - Position
    - Colors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterate based on data">
    - High view, low click: Message isn't compelling
    - High click, low resolution: Agent needs better training
    - Low view: Trigger timing/conditions need adjustment
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Mistakes

<Warning>
  **Don't do these:**
</Warning>

1. **Triggering on page load** - Let users settle first
2. **Too many triggers** - Causes fatigue and annoyance
3. **Generic messages** - "Need help?" is forgettable
4. **Blocking the page** - Never prevent users from continuing
5. **No dismiss option** - Always let users close triggers
6. **Same trigger repeatedly** - Respect when users say no
7. **Ignoring mobile** - Test on all devices
8. **No analytics** - You can't improve what you don't measure

## Checklist

Before launching triggers, verify:

- [ ] Timing feels natural, not aggressive
- [ ] Messages are specific and helpful
- [ ] Agent is trained on relevant content
- [ ] Dismissals are respected
- [ ] Works on mobile devices
- [ ] Analytics tracking is in place
- [ ] Rate limits won't be exceeded
- [ ] Legal/privacy requirements are met
