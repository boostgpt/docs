## Accessing the Events Page

1. Log in to your BoostGPT dashboard
2. Navigate to **Agents** and select your agent
3. Click **Events** in the sidebar

## Creating a New Event

Click **Create Event** to open the event form.

### Basic Information

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Unique identifier (no spaces, use snake_case) | `checkout_abandoned` |
| **Label** | Display name shown in dashboard | "Checkout Abandoned" |
| **Description** | Notes about this event | "Triggered when user leaves checkout page" |

### Prompt Template

The prompt template defines what message your agent receives when this event triggers.

**Without template:**
Your agent receives a generic message built from the context data.

**With template:**
Your agent receives a customized message with context variables injected.

```
User named {{user_name}} ({{user_email}}) abandoned their cart.

Cart details:
- Value: {{cart_value}}
- Items: {{items_count}}
- Last item viewed: {{last_item}}

Time on checkout page: {{time_on_page}} seconds.

Help them complete their purchase. Be friendly and offer assistance
with any concerns about shipping, payment, or the products.
```

### Active Status

Toggle whether this event is active. Inactive events:
- Won't respond to trigger calls
- Won't count toward your trigger limit
- Are useful for temporarily disabling triggers

## Managing Events

### Events List

The Events tab shows all your events with:
- Event name and label
- Trigger count (this month)
- Active/inactive status
- Quick actions (edit, delete, toggle)

### Editing Events

Click the edit button on any event to modify:
- Label and description
- Prompt template
- Active status

Note: Event **names** cannot be changed after creation. If you need a different name, create a new event.

### Deleting Events

Delete events you no longer need. This:
- Removes the event definition
- Does not delete historical trigger logs
- Future trigger calls for this event name will auto-create a new event

## Event Limits

Your plan determines how many triggers you can make per month:

| Plan | Triggers/Month |
|------|----------------|
| Free | 100 |
| Starter | 1,000 |
| Pro | 5,000 |
| Prime | 20,000 |
| Scale | Unlimited |

Limits apply to total triggers across all events, not per event.

## Trigger Logs

View trigger history in the **Logs** tab:

- Timestamp of each trigger
- Event name triggered
- Context data passed
- User info (if provided)
- Source URL
- Resulting chat URL

Use logs to:
- Debug trigger implementations
- Analyze user friction patterns
- Understand which events fire most often
