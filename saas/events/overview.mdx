## What Are Events?

Events represent friction points in your application where users might need help. Each event has:

- **Name**: A unique identifier (e.g., `checkout_abandoned`, `signup_stuck`)
- **Label**: A human-readable display name
- **Description**: What this event represents
- **Prompt Template**: Instructions for your agent with context placeholders

## The Trigger Flow

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Your Code     │────▶│  Trigger API    │────▶│   Your Agent    │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│ trigger(event,  │     │ Builds message  │     │ Responds with   │
│   context)      │     │ from template   │     │ context         │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

1. **Your code** detects a friction point and calls `boostgpt.trigger()`
2. **The API** finds the event, builds a message using the template and context
3. **Your agent** receives the message and generates a helpful response
4. **The user** sees the trigger UI, clicks, and starts a conversation

## Context Variables

Context is the data you pass with each trigger. It gets injected into the prompt template.

```javascript
// Your trigger call
boostgpt.trigger('checkout_abandoned', {
  cart_value: '$149.00',
  items_count: 3,
  user_name: 'Sarah'
});
```

```
// Your prompt template
A user named {{user_name}} abandoned checkout with {{items_count}} items
worth {{cart_value}}. Help them complete their purchase.
```

```
// Resulting message to agent
A user named Sarah abandoned checkout with 3 items worth $149.00.
Help them complete their purchase.
```

## Auto-Created Events

If you trigger an event that doesn't exist, it's automatically created with:
- **Name**: The event name you provided
- **Label**: Auto-generated from name (e.g., `checkout_abandoned` → "Checkout Abandoned")
- **Prompt Template**: Default template that includes all context

This lets you start triggering immediately without pre-configuring events.

## Event Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier (snake_case recommended) |
| `label` | No | Display name in dashboard |
| `description` | No | Notes about when/why this event triggers |
| `prompt_template` | No | Template with `{{variable}}` placeholders |
| `is_active` | No | Whether this event is enabled (default: true) |

## Edit Mode Progress Events

When using `chat_mode: 'edit'`, the following progress events are emitted during processing:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `editing` | Edit mode LLM call started — analyzing the requested code changes |
| `applying_patches` | Backend is applying search/replace diffs to the original code |
| `fallback` | No diffs matched — falling back to full code regeneration |

These events only fire during edit mode requests and can be used to show progress indicators in your UI.

## Plan Mode Progress Events

When using `chat_mode: 'plan'`, the following progress events are emitted during processing:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `thinking_token` | Streamed tokens while the plan is being generated (shown as a thinking indicator in the UI) |
| `generating` | Plan synthesis started — the AI is preparing a polished plan response (message: "Preparing plan...") |

These events only fire during plan mode requests. Once a plan is approved and execution begins, standard tool execution events are emitted instead.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive event names">
    Names should clearly indicate the friction point:
    - ✅ `checkout_payment_failed`
    - ✅ `onboarding_step3_stuck`
    - ❌ `event1`
    - ❌ `help_needed`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include relevant context">
    Pass information that helps your agent provide better assistance:
    - Current page or step
    - Error messages (if applicable)
    - User's progress or history
    - Product/cart details
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Write clear prompt templates">
    Templates should give your agent enough context to help immediately:
    ```
    // Good template
    User is stuck on the {{step_name}} step of onboarding.
    They've been on this page for {{time_spent}} seconds.
    Error shown (if any): {{error_message}}.
    Help them proceed.

    // Too vague
    User needs help with {{step}}.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Event Lifecycle

1. **Created**: Event is defined in dashboard or auto-created on first trigger
2. **Triggered**: User hits friction point, your code calls `boostgpt.trigger()`
3. **Logged**: Trigger is recorded for analytics (timestamp, context, IP, etc.)
4. **Chat Created**: New conversation starts with context-aware first message
5. **Resolved**: User gets help, friction point addressed
