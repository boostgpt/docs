description: "Using context variables to create dynamic agent prompts"
---

## Template Syntax

Prompt templates use `{{variable}}` syntax to inject context data.

```
User {{user_name}} needs help with {{issue_type}}.
Current page: {{current_page}}
```

When triggered with:
```javascript
boostgpt.trigger('support_needed', {
  user_name: 'Sarah',
  issue_type: 'payment',
  current_page: '/checkout'
});
```

Your agent receives:
```
User Sarah needs help with payment.
Current page: /checkout
```

## Variable Rules

### Case Sensitivity

Variable names are case-sensitive:
- `{{userName}}` ≠ `{{username}}` ≠ `{{UserName}}`

Match the exact case used in your trigger call.

### Missing Variables

If a variable isn't provided in context:
- The placeholder remains as-is: `{{missing_var}}`
- Consider providing defaults or handling in your template

```
User: {{user_name}}
{{#if user_email}}Email: {{user_email}}{{/if}}
```

### Special Characters

Context values are included as-is. Escape special characters if needed:
- User input might contain quotes, HTML, etc.
- Consider sanitizing sensitive data before passing

### Error Recovery

```
⚠️ ERROR ASSISTANCE

User encountered an error:
- Error code: {{error_code}}
- Error message: {{error_message}}
- Page: {{current_page}}
- Action attempted: {{attempted_action}}

User context:
- Browser: {{browser}}
- Device: {{device_type}}

This error typically occurs when: {{error_explanation}}

Help the user:
1. Acknowledge the frustration of encountering an error
2. Explain what might have caused it in simple terms
3. Provide steps to resolve or work around the issue
4. Offer to escalate to human support if needed
```

## Building Natural Messages

For events without custom templates, the system builds a natural message from context:

**Context:**
```javascript
{
  event: 'checkout_error',
  cart_value: '$149',
  error_type: 'payment_declined',
  user_email: 'user@example.com'
}
```

**Auto-generated message:**
```
The user encountered a checkout_error event.

Context:
- cart_value: $149
- error_type: payment_declined
- user_email: user@example.com

Please assist them based on this information.
```

Custom templates are recommended for better agent responses.

## User Data in Templates

Pass user information via the `user` option:

```javascript
boostgpt.trigger('help_needed', {
  page: '/settings'
}, {
  user: {
    id: 'user_123',
    email: 'sarah@example.com',
    name: 'Sarah Chen',
    plan: 'pro'
  }
});
```

Access in templates:
```
User: {{user.name}} ({{user.email}})
Plan: {{user.plan}}
User ID: {{user.id}}
```

## Tips for Effective Templates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about the situation">
    Don't just say "user needs help" — describe the exact scenario:
    - What were they trying to do?
    - What went wrong or where did they get stuck?
    - What's their current state?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include actionable instructions">
    Tell your agent how to help:
    - What solutions to offer
    - What tone to use
    - What to avoid saying
    - When to escalate
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide context for better responses">
    More context = better help:
    - User's history with your product
    - Common issues at this point
    - Relevant policies or limitations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep it scannable">
    Use formatting to make templates easy to read:
    - Headers and sections
    - Bullet points for lists
    - Clear labels for data
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
