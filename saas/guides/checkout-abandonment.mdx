## The Problem

Cart abandonment rates average 70%. Users leave for many reasons:
- Unexpected shipping costs
- Complicated checkout process
- Security concerns
- Distractions or comparison shopping
- Payment issues

## The Solution

Deploy proactive triggers that engage users before they leave, addressing their concerns in real-time.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Create the Event

Create an event in your dashboard:

- **Name**: `checkout_abandoned`
- **Label**: "Checkout Abandonment"
- **Prompt Template**:

```
🛒 CHECKOUT ASSISTANCE

A customer needs help completing their purchase.

Cart Information:
- Total: {{cart_total}}
- Items: {{item_count}}
- Last item added: {{last_item}}

Customer Context:
- Time on checkout: {{time_on_page}} seconds
- Page: {{checkout_step}}
- Previous purchases: {{previous_orders}}

Common reasons for abandonment at this stage:
1. Shipping cost concerns
2. Payment security questions
3. Return policy questions
4. Discount code requests
5. Product questions

Instructions:
- Greet them warmly, acknowledge they may have questions
- Ask if there's anything specific holding them back
- Be ready to explain shipping, returns, and payment security
- If they mention price, you can offer assistance finding applicable discounts
- Don't be pushy - respect if they want to think about it
```

### Step 2: Detect Abandonment Signals

Trigger when users show abandonment behavior:

```javascript
// Track time on checkout page
let checkoutStartTime = Date.now();
let triggered = false;

// Trigger after 45 seconds of inactivity
let inactivityTimer;
function resetInactivityTimer() {
  clearTimeout(inactivityTimer);
  if (!triggered) {
    inactivityTimer = setTimeout(triggerHelp, 45000);
  }
}

// Trigger on exit intent
document.addEventListener('mouseleave', function(e) {
  if (e.clientY < 0 && !triggered) {
    triggerHelp();
  }
});

// Reset on user activity
['mousemove', 'keypress', 'scroll', 'click'].forEach(event => {
  document.addEventListener(event, resetInactivityTimer);
});

function triggerHelp() {
  if (triggered) return;
  triggered = true;

  const timeOnPage = Math.round((Date.now() - checkoutStartTime) / 1000);

  boostgpt.trigger('checkout_abandoned', {
    cart_total: getCartTotal(),
    item_count: getCartItemCount(),
    last_item: getLastItemName(),
    time_on_page: timeOnPage,
    checkout_step: getCurrentStep(),
    previous_orders: getUserOrderCount()
  }, {
    type: 'toast',
    position: 'bottom-right',
    title: 'Shopping Assistant',
    message: 'Having trouble checking out? I can help!',
    buttonColor: '#10B981'
  });
}

// Start tracking
if (isCheckoutPage()) {
  resetInactivityTimer();
}
```

### Step 3: Customize the Trigger Style

Choose the right approach based on your brand:

**Friendly Toast (Recommended)**
```javascript
{
  type: 'toast',
  title: 'Sarah from Support',
  avatar: '/images/sarah-avatar.jpg',
  messages: [
    'Hey! 👋',
    'I noticed you might have some questions about your order.',
    'Happy to help with shipping, returns, or anything else!'
  ]
}
```

**Subtle Button**
```javascript
{
  type: 'button',
  buttonText: 'Questions? Chat now',
  buttonColor: '#059669',
  position: 'bottom-right'
}
```

**Urgent Banner (for flash sales)**
```javascript
{
  type: 'banner',
  position: 'top',
  bannerText: 'Sale ends in 2 hours! Need help checking out?',
  bannerColor: '#DC2626',
  buttonText: 'Get Help'
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Time the trigger right">
    - Don't trigger immediately - give users time to browse
    - 30-60 seconds of inactivity is a good threshold
    - Exit intent is highly effective but can feel aggressive
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't be pushy">
    - One trigger per session is usually enough
    - Respect user's decision if they dismiss
    - Avoid blocking the checkout process
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Personalize when possible">
    - Use customer name if available
    - Reference specific items in cart
    - Mention relevant policies (free shipping threshold, etc.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Train your agent well">
    - Include shipping and return policies in training
    - Add common FAQs
    - Enable the agent to check order status if applicable
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
