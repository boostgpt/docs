## The Problem

Users often don't know about features that could help them:
- Hidden in menus they never explore
- Released after they signed up
- Seem advanced or intimidating
- Not obviously relevant to their use case

## The Solution

Use behavioral signals to proactively introduce relevant features at the right moment.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Define Feature Events

Create events for features you want to promote:

**Event: `feature_discovery_bulk_import`**
```
✨ FEATURE DISCOVERY - Bulk Import

User might benefit from bulk import. They've added {{items_added}} items manually.

Feature Details:
- Bulk import from CSV/Excel
- Supports up to 10,000 rows at once
- Auto-maps common column names

User Context:
- Items added manually: {{items_added}}
- Time spent adding: {{time_spent}} minutes
- Current page: {{current_page}}

Instructions:
- Introduce the bulk import feature naturally
- Explain how it would save them time
- Offer to walk them through the first import
- Don't be pushy - they may prefer manual entry
```

**Event: `feature_discovery_keyboard_shortcuts`**
```
⌨️ FEATURE DISCOVERY - Keyboard Shortcuts

Power user detected! They might love our keyboard shortcuts.

User Activity:
- Actions in last hour: {{action_count}}
- Most used features: {{top_features}}
- Using keyboard: {{keyboard_usage}}%

Keyboard shortcuts available:
- Cmd/Ctrl + K: Quick search
- Cmd/Ctrl + N: New item
- Cmd/Ctrl + S: Save
- ?: Show all shortcuts

Introduce shortcuts as a way to speed up their workflow.
```

### Step 2: Detect Behavioral Signals

```javascript
class FeatureDiscovery {
  constructor() {
    this.userActivity = {
      manualAdds: 0,
      searches: 0,
      exports: 0,
      actionCount: 0,
      keyboardUsage: 0
    };
    this.discoveredFeatures = new Set(
      JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('discovered_features') || '[]')
    );
  }

  track(action, data = {}) {
    this.userActivity.actionCount++;

    switch (action) {
      case 'item_added_manually':
        this.userActivity.manualAdds++;
        if (this.userActivity.manualAdds === 10) {
          this.suggestFeature('bulk_import');
        }
        break;

      case 'search_performed':
        this.userActivity.searches++;
        if (this.userActivity.searches > 20 && !this.discoveredFeatures.has('saved_filters')) {
          this.suggestFeature('saved_filters');
        }
        break;

      case 'export_clicked':
        this.userActivity.exports++;
        if (this.userActivity.exports === 3) {
          this.suggestFeature('api_access');
        }
        break;

      case 'keyboard_shortcut_used':
        // They already know about shortcuts
        this.discoveredFeatures.add('keyboard_shortcuts');
        break;
    }

    // Power user detection
    if (this.userActivity.actionCount > 50 && !this.discoveredFeatures.has('keyboard_shortcuts')) {
      this.suggestFeature('keyboard_shortcuts');
    }
  }

  suggestFeature(featureId) {
    if (this.discoveredFeatures.has(featureId)) return;

    const feature = this.features[featureId];
    if (!feature) return;

    boostgpt.trigger(`feature_discovery_${featureId}`, {
      ...this.userActivity,
      feature_id: featureId
    }, {
      type: 'toast',
      position: 'bottom-right',
      title: 'Pro Tip',
      message: feature.teaser,
      buttonColor: '#6366F1'
    });

    this.discoveredFeatures.add(featureId);
    localStorage.setItem('discovered_features', JSON.stringify([...this.discoveredFeatures]));
  }

  features = {
    bulk_import: {
      teaser: 'Did you know you can import items in bulk? Could save you hours!'
    },
    saved_filters: {
      teaser: 'You search a lot! Want to learn about saved filters?'
    },
    keyboard_shortcuts: {
      teaser: 'Power user spotted! Want to learn our keyboard shortcuts?'
    },
    api_access: {
      teaser: 'Exporting often? Our API might be perfect for your workflow.'
    },
    automation: {
      teaser: 'This seems repetitive. Want to learn about automations?'
    }
  };
}

// Initialize and use
const discovery = new FeatureDiscovery();

// Track throughout your app
document.querySelector('.add-item-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
  discovery.track('item_added_manually');
});
```

### Step 3: Context-Aware Suggestions

```javascript
// Suggest features based on current context
function checkContextualFeatures() {
  const page = getCurrentPage();
  const userPlan = getUserPlan();

  // On reports page, suggest exports
  if (page === 'reports' && !discovery.discoveredFeatures.has('scheduled_reports')) {
    boostgpt.trigger('feature_discovery_scheduled_reports', {
      current_page: page,
      report_count: getReportCount()
    }, {
      type: 'inline',
      container: '#feature-callout',
      buttonText: 'Learn about scheduled reports',
      buttonColor: '#8B5CF6'
    });
  }

  // Near plan limits, suggest upgrade features
  if (userPlan === 'starter' && getUsagePercent() > 80) {
    boostgpt.trigger('feature_discovery_pro_features', {
      current_plan: userPlan,
      usage_percent: getUsagePercent()
    }, {
      type: 'banner',
      position: 'top',
      bannerText: 'You\'re using 80% of your plan. Chat with us about Pro features!',
      bannerColor: '#7C3AED'
    });
  }
}
```

## Trigger Timing

| Signal | Feature | Timing |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 10 manual entries | Bulk Import | Immediately after 10th |
| 20+ searches | Saved Filters | On next search |
| 50+ actions/hour | Keyboard Shortcuts | After 5 min of activity |
| 3 exports | API Access | On 3rd export |
| High plan usage | Pro Features | When > 80% usage |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Don't interrupt critical flows">
    Never interrupt:
    - Active editing
    - Payment flows
    - Export processes

    Wait for natural pauses in activity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Respect dismissals">
    If a user dismisses a feature suggestion:
    - Don't show it again for at least 7 days
    - Consider it "discovered" even if declined
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Personalize the pitch">
    Instead of: "Check out bulk import!"
    Try: "You've added 10 items manually. Bulk import could save you time!"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limit frequency">
    - Max 1 feature suggestion per session
    - Max 3 per week
    - Never more than 1 banner at a time
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Measuring Success

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Feature Adoption | % of users who try suggested feature |
| Time to Discovery | Days from signup to feature use |
| Engagement Rate | % of suggestions clicked |
| Feature Retention | Users still using feature after 30 days |
