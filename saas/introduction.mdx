## Proactive AI Agents for SaaS

Turn user friction into engagement opportunities. BoostGPT's trigger system lets you deploy AI agents exactly when your users need help most.

## How It Works

```
User hits friction point → Your code calls boostgpt.trigger()
    → Trigger UI appears → User clicks → Agent responds with context
    → User gets help → Friction resolved
```

**Example Flow:**
1. User abandons checkout with items in cart
2. Your code detects this and calls `boostgpt.trigger('checkout_abandoned', { cartValue: '$149' })`
3. A friendly chat button appears: "Having trouble checking out?"
4. User clicks, agent already knows their situation and offers help
5. User completes purchase

## Use Cases

- **Checkout Abandonment** - Re-engage users who start but don't complete purchases
- **Onboarding Friction** - Help users who get stuck during signup or setup
- **Feature Discovery** - Proactively introduce features users might find useful
- **Error Recovery** - Offer assistance when users encounter errors
- **Upgrade Prompts** - Guide users hitting plan limits toward upgrades
